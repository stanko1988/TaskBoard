# TaskBoard JS App + RESTful API

The JS app "Task Board" holds a board of tasks. Tasks have state, which is displayed as columns (boards): Open, In Progress, Done. The app supports the following operations:
 - Home page (view tasks count + menu): `/`
 - View the boards with tasks: `/boards`
 - View the tasks by given board: `/board/:board`
 - Search tasks form: `/tasks/search`
 - Search tasks by keyword: `/tasks/search/:keyword`
 - View task details (by id): `/tasks/view/:id`
 - Add new task (title + decription): `/tasks/create`
 - Edit task / move to board: `/tasks/edit/:id`

## App Details

The app is based on Node.js + Express.js + Pug.
 - It has **no database** and app data is not persistent!
